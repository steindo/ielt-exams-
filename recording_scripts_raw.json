Each Academic Module candidate Will take the same test, no matter what his or her English level is. Similarly, each General Training candidate Will take the same General Training test.

Lower-level language students generally need more guided practice and there are exercises in this book to provide this. However, they also need in pvnrpccino thic",

Similarly, more advanced students need frequent opportunities for self-expression, but they also need to become more self-critical and aware of their own common mistakes.

  "because the tasks and information are graded, developing your skills as the units progress. However. the different skills can be covered in any order. For example, you may decide to concentrate on only one skill at a time, or you may want to work on all four skills to provide a more balanced course. You should Study all of the skills units before taking the Practice Tests. When taking the Practice Tests, try to use the tips and strategies recommended in the skills units. You should also try to take the tests under exam conditions and stick closely to the time limits in the test.",
  "How is this book different from other books? The skills units and Practice Tests have been written by IELTS exam writers, so you can be sure they contain authentic, accurate and up-to-date information and advice. For the first time, we have also included a DVD showing IELTS Speaking tests, along with a commentary to explain the candidates' scores. Our writers have used the Cambridge Learner Corpus to help choose the most appropriate language and skill areas to focus on.",
  "VVhat is the Cambridge Learner Corpus? The Cambridge Learner Corpus is the world's largest learner corpus. It is made up of thousands of exam scripts written by students from all over the world who have taken Cambridge ESOL exams. The corpus allows us to see the types of error candidates commonly make in the IELTS exam at each different level. What iq 'paraphrase' and Why is it imoortant?",
  "Paraphrase is the use of different words to express the same idea. In order to test whether you have understood the Reading and Listening texts, the questions in IELTS will paraphrase the words used in the texts. In the Writing and Speaking sections of the test, being able to use paraphrase, instead of Simply repeating and copying the words in the question, will show that you have a wide vocabulary and help you to achieve a higher score. So, using and understanding paraphrase is important in every part of the test.",

'In my view, the gecko attachment system is over-designed,' says Stark. and Stark adds that when the soggy lizards were faced with the misted and immersed horizontal surfaces, they slipped as soon as the rig started pulling. Therefore geckos can walk on wet surfaces, as long as their feet are reasonably dry, However„ as soon as their feet get wet, they are barely able to hang on, and the team is keen to understand how long it takes geckos to recoverfrom a drenching,",

The question of Why some words evolve rapidly through time while others are preserved — Often with the same meaning in multiple languages — has long plagued linguists, IWO independent teams of researchers have tackled this question from different angles, each arriving at a remarkably similar conclusion. \"The frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and law-like influence on their rates of evolution,\" writes Mark Pagel, author of one of two studies published this week.",
  "Anyone who has tried to learn English will have been struck by its excess of stubbornly irregular verbs, which render grammatical rules unreliable. The past tense of regular verbs is formed by adding the suffix '-ed', but this luxury is not afforded to their irregular kin. Over time, however, some irregular verbs 'regularise'. For instance, the past tense of 'help' used to be Sholp', but now it is 'helped'. Mathematician Erez Lieberman, from Harvard University in Massachusetts, US, performed a quantitative Study of the rate at which English verbs such as 'help' have become more regular with time. Of the list of 177 irregular verbs they took from Old English, only 98 are still irregular",
  "today. Amazingly, the changes they observed Obey a very precise mathematical description: the half-life of an irregular verb is proportional to the square root of its frequency. In other words, they found that the more an irregular verb is used, the longer it will remain irregular. A separate group of academics, led by evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel from the University of Reading, in the UK, used a statistical modelling technique to Study the evolution of words from 87 different Indo-European languages. \"Throughout its 8,000-year history, all Indo-European-language speakers have used a related sound to communicate the idea of •two' objects — duo, due, deux, dos, etc.\" Pagel commented. \"But.\" he adds_ ' 'therp aro manv RifforAnt",

Certainly, our mouths and tonaues have taste With the savory elements of eating, one of the most enjoyed of human experiences. ln many ways, he is discovering that smell is rather like face recognition.

As we eat, specialised receptors in the back of the nose detect the air molecules in our meals. From signals sent by the receptors, the brain understands smetls as complex spatial patterns. Using these, as well as input from the other senses, it constructs the idea of specific flavors.",

Unlike a hound's skull with its extra long nose, which evolved specifically to detect external smells, our noses have evolved to detect internal scents. Primates specialise in savoring the many millions of flavor combinations that they can create for their mouths, Ihts ability to appreciate specific aromas turns out to be central to the pleasure we get from food, much as our ability to recognise individuals is central to the pleasures of social life. The process is so embedded in our brains that our sense of smell is critical to our enjoyment of life at large. Recent studies show that people who lose the ability to smell become socially insecure, and their overall level of happiness plummets.",

Smell has been the most poorly understood of our senses, and only recently has neuroscience, led by Yale University's Gordon Shepherd, begun to shed light on its workings. Shepherd has come up with the term 'neurogastronomy' to link the disciplines of food science, neurology, psychologyr and anthropology scientists, psychologists, and cooks alike. The relatively new discipline Of molecular gastronomy, especially, relies on understanding the mechanics of aroma to manipulate flavorfor maximum impact. In this discipline, chefs use their knowledge of the chemical changes that take place during cooking to produce eating pleasures that go beyond the 'ordinary'.",

The faster the foragers come back, the more food there is and the faster other foragers go out, until gradually the amount of food being brought back diminishes.An organic calculation has been made to answer the question, 'How many foragers does the colony need today?'

Citizens in Vermont control their municipal affairs by putting forward proposals, or backing up others' suggestions, until a consensus is reached through a vote.

Termites do not have an architect's blueprint or a grand construction scheme.

Within six months of starting his research, Zhang had given up on traditional methods, He was frustrated by the cost of hiring designers and specialists for each new structure. The best way to cut costs, he decided, was to take building to the factory. But to create a factory-built skyscraper, Broad had to abandon the principles by which skyscrapers are typically designed.

Yet as Scott was nearing the pole and with the rest of the world still unaware of Amundsen's triumph, Shirase and his team sailed into Antarcticas Bay of Whales in the smallest ship ever to try its luck in these dangerous waters. Ukuma came to Shirase•s rescue. Okuma's backing, Shirase got together just enough money to buy and equip a small ship. He eventually acquired a scientist, too, called Terutaro Takeda. At the end of November 1910, his ship the Kainan Maru finally left Tokyo with 27 men and 28 Siberian dogs on board. Before leaving, Shirase confidently outlined his plans to the media. He would sail",

For many of them, the question wasnt could he do it but Why would it be worth doing? 15 years earlier the International Geographical Congress had said that as the last unknown continent the Antarctic offered the chance to add to knowledge in almost every branch of science. So, like the British, Shirase presented his expedition as a search for knowledge: he astonished: the ship was half the size of AmundsenÉ ship. True, it was reinforced with iron plate and extra wood, but the ship had only the feeblest engine to help force its way through ice.

  "B The most famous of the Western tradition's oral works, and the first to have been systematically studied, were Homer's Odyssey and Iliad. These two poems — possibly the first to have been written down in the Greek alphabet — had long been held up as literary archetypes. However, even as they were celebrated as the models to which all literature should aspire, Homer's masterworks had also long been the source of scholarly unease. The earliest modern critics sensed that they were somehow qualitatively different from everything that came after — even a little strange.

The same narrative units — gathering armies, heroic shields, challenges between rivals — pop up again and again, only with different characters and different circumstances.

He suggested that the reason Homer's epics seemed unlike other literature was because they were unlike other literature. Parry had discovered what Wood and Wolf had missed: the evidence that the poems had been transmitted orally was right there in the text itself.

For this reason, some scientists are wary. Whale expert Karen Evans is one such scientist.

NATO later admitted it had been testing new sonar technology in the same area at the time as the strandings occur around Tasmania, Gales and her team must continue in the search for answers. When animals beach next to each other at the same time, the most common cause has nothing to do with humans at all. \"%ey're highly social creatures,\" says Gales. \"When they mass strand - it's complete panic and chaos.

He leads a team designing a centrifuge for humans. ln their preliminary the agency reduces the time between approving experiments and sending them into space, it also recommended setting clearer research priorities, NASA has already begun to take action, hiring management consultants ProOrbis to develop a plan to cut through the bureaucracy.And Congress also directed NASA to hire an independent organisation, the Centre for the Advancement of Science in",

  "The Swiffer For a fascinating tale about creativity, look at a cleaning called the Swiffer and how it came about, urges writer Jonah Lehrer. In the story of the Swiffer, he argues, we have the key elements in producing breakthrough ideas: frustration, moments of insight and sheer hard work. The story starts with a multinational company which had invented products for keeping homes spotless, and couldn't come up with better ways to clean floors, so it hired designers to watch how people cleaned. Frustrated after hundreds",
  "of hours of observation, they one day noticed a woman do with a paper towel what people do all the time: wipe something up and throw it away. An idea popped into lead designer Harry West's head: the solution to their problem was a floor mop with a disposable cleaning surface. Mountains of prototypes and years of teamwork later, they unveiled the Swiffer, which quickly became a commercial success. Lehrer, the author of Imagine, a new book that seeks to explain how creativity works, says this Study of the imagination started from a desire to understand what happens in the brain at the moment of sudden insight, 'But the book definitely spiraled out",
  "'eureka'* moment, but when you press them they also talk about the hard work that comes afterwards, so I realised I needed to write about that, too. And then I realised I couldn't just look at creativity from the perspective of the brain, because it's also about the culture and context, about the group and the team and the way we collaborate.' When it comes to the mysterious process by which inspiration comes into your head as if from nowhere, Lehrer says modern neuroscience has produced a 'first drafti explanation of what is happening in the brain. He writes of how burnt-out American singer Bob Dylan decided to walk away from his musical career in 1965 and escape to a",

'It gives you the song and it goes away.' But it's no ghost, according to Lehrer. Instead, the right hemisphere of the brain is assembling connections between past influences and making something entirely new. Neuroscientists have roughly charted this process by mapping the brains of people doing word puzzles solved by making sense of remotely connecting information. For instance, subjects are given three words",

(It happens to be 'stone' Using brain-imaging equipmenti researchers discovered that when people get the answer in an apparent flash of insight, a small fold of tissue called the anterior superior temporal gyrus suddenly lights up just beforehand. This stays silent when the word puzzle is solved through careful analysis. Lehrer says that this area of the brain lights up only after we've hit the wall on a problem. Then the brain starts hunting through the 'filing cabinets of the right hemisphere' to make the connections that produce the right answer.",

Today our number of weak-tie contacts has number of genuine social relationships we can actually cope with: roughly 150.

  "'1 ne Yenny blacK It might not have looked very impressive, but the Penny Black, now 170 years Old, was the first stamp to be created and it launched the modern postal system in Britain. Before 1840 and the arrival of the Penny Black, you had to be rich and patient to use the Royal Mail. Delivery was charged according to the miles travelled and the number of sheets of paper used; a 2-page letter sent from Edinburgh to London, for example, would have cost",
  "to deliver it, it was the recipient who had to pay for the postage. Letter writers employed various ruses to reduce the cost, doing everything possible to cram more words onto a page. Nobody bothered with heavy envelopes; instead, letters would be folded and sealed with wax, You then had to find a post office — there were no pillar boxes —and hope your addressee didn't live in one of the several rural areas which were not served by the system. If you were lucky. your letter would arrive (it could take days) without being read or censored. The state of mail had been causing concern throughout the 1830s, but it was Rowland Hill, an inventor, teacher and social reformer from Kidderminster, who proposed a workable plan for",
  "change. Worricd that a dysfunctional, costly service would stifle communication just as Britain was in the swing of its second industrial revolution, he believed reform would ease the distribution of ideas and stimulate trade and business, delivering the same promise as the new railways. Hill 's proposa' for the penny post, which meant any letter weighing Iess than half an ounce (14 grams) could be sent anywhere in Britain for about 30p in today's money, was so radical that the Postmaster General, Lord Lichfield, said, 'Of all the wild and visionary schemes which I ever heard of, it is the most extravagant. ' Lord Lichfield spoke for an establishment",
  "backed Hill. Soon the government told him to make his scheme work. And that meant inventing a new type of currency. Hill quickly settled on 'a bit of paper covered at the back with a glutinous wash which lhe user might, by applying a little moisture, attach to the back Ofa letter'. Stamps would be printed in sheets of 240 that could be cut using scissors or a knife. Perforations would not arrive until 1854. The idea stuck, and in August 1839 the Treasury launched a design competition open to 'all artists, men of science and the public in general'. The new stamp would need to be resistant to forgerv, and so it was a submission by one Mr Cheverton that Hill used as the",
  "basis for one of the most striking designs in history. Cheverton, who worked as a sculptor and an engineer, determined that a portrait of Queen Victoria, engraved for a commemorative coin when she was a 15-year-old was detailed enough to make copying difiicult, and recognisable enough to make fakes easy to spot. The words 'Postage' and 'One Penny' were added alongside flourishes and ornamental stars. Nobody thought to add the word ' Britain', as it was assumed that the stamps would solely be put to domestic use, With the introduction of the new postal system, the Penny Black was an instant hit, and printers struggled to meet demand.

And as literacy improved, sections Of society that had been disenfranchised found a voiee. Tristram Hunt, an historian, values the 'flourishing of correspondence' that followed the arrival of stamps.

'They wrote to each other three times a day, pinging ideas back and forth so that you can almost follow a real-",
  "time correspondence. ' The penny post also changed the nature of the letter. Weight-saving tricks such as cross-writing began to die out, while the arrival of envelopes built confidence among correspondents that mail would not be stolen or read. And so people wrote more private things — politically or commercially sensitive information or love letters. 'In the early days of the penny post, there was still concern about theft,' Hunt says. 'Engels would still send Marx money by ripping up five-pound notes and sending the Pieces in different letters.' But the probity of the postal system became a great thing and it came to be expected that your mail",

  "in US film history, It also focuses on the two key elements which influenced the emergence of the classic Hollywood studio system: the advent of sound and the business ideal of vertical integration. In addition to its historical interest, inspecting the growth of the studio system may offer clues regarding the kinds of struggles that accompany the growth of any new medium. It might, in fact, be intriguing to examine which changes occurred during the growth of the Hollywood studio, and compare those changes to contemporary struggles in which production companies are trying to define and control emerging",

Warner Bros.' 1927 film The Jazz Singer was the first to feature synchronized speech, and with it came a period of mrmoil for the Studios now had proof that 'talkie' films would make them money, but the financial investment this kind of filmmaking would require, from new camera equipment to new projection facilities, made the studios to invest at first. In the end, the power of cinematic sound to both move audiences and enhance the story persuaded studios that talkies were worth investing in. Overall, the use of sound in film was well-received by audiencas, but",
  "C there were still many technical factors to consider. Although full integration of sound into movies was complete by 1930, it would take somewhat longer for thern to regain their stylistic elegance and dexterity. The camera now had to be encased in a big, clumsy, unmoveable soundproof box. In addition, actors struggled, having to direct their speech to awkwardly-hidden microphones in huge plants, telephones or even costumes. Vertical integration is the other key component in the rise of the Hollywood studio system. The major studios realized they could increase their profits by",
  "(getting the film out to people) and exhibition (owning the theaters in major cities where films were shown first). Five studios, 'The Big Five', worked to achieve vertical integration through the late 1940s, owning vast real estate on which to construct elaborate sets. In addition, these studios set the exact terrns of films' release dates and patterns. Warner Bros., Paramount, 20th Century Fox, MGM and RKO formed this exclusive club. The Little Three' studios — Universal, Columbia and United Affists — also made pictures, but each Iacked one of the crucial elements of vertical integration. Together these eight companies operated",

  "D Reading During the Golden Age, the studios were remarkably consistent and stable enterprises, due in large part to long-term management heads — the infamous 'movie moguls' who ruled their kingdoms with iron fists. At MGM, Warner Bros. and Columbia, the same men ran their studios for decades. The rise of the studio system also hinges on the treatment of stars, who were constructed",
  "E and exploited to suit a studio's image and schedule. Actors were bound up in seven-year contracts to a single studio, and the studio boss generally held all the options. Stars could be Ioaned out to other production companies at any time. Studio bosses could also force bad roles on actors, and manipulate every single detail of stars' images with their mammoth in-house publicity departments. Some have compared the Hollywood studio system to a factow, and it is useful to remember that studios were out to make money first and art second. On the other hand, studios also had to cultivate flexibility, in addition to",

Examining how each production company tried to differentiate itself has led to loose characterizations of individual studios' styles.

In the United States versus Paramount federal decree of that year, the studios were ordered to give up their theaters in what is commonly referred to as 'divestiture' — opening the market to smaller producers. This, coupled with the advent of television in the 1950s, seriously compromised the studio system's influence and profits. Hence, 1930 and 1948 are generally considered bookends to Hollywood's Golden Age.",

  "B brain, which generally controls the opposite side of the body, is more dominant than the other when processing certain tasks. This does, on some occasions, let the animal down: such as when a toad fails to escape from a Snake approaching from the right, just because its right eye is worse at spotting danger than its left. So Why would animals evolve a characteristic that seems to endanger them? For many years it was assumed that lateralisation was a uniquely human trait, but this notion rapidly fell apart as researchers started uncovering evidence of lateralisation in all sorts of animals. For example, in the 1970s, Lesley Rogers, now at the University of",
  "C New England in Australia, was studying memory and learmng ln Chl CkS. sne had been injecting a chemical into chicks' brains to stop them learning how to spot grains of food among distracting pebbles, and was surprised to observe that the chemical only worked when applied to the left hemisphere of the brain. That strongly suggested that the right side of the chick's brain played little or no role in the learning of such behaviours. Similar evidence appeared in songbirds and rats around the same time, and since then, researchers have built up an impressive catalogue of animal lateralisation. In some animals, lateralisation is Simply a preference for a single paw or foot, while in",
  "D brains, for example, seems to process and control feeding. Since the left hemisphere processes input from the right side of the body, that means animals as diverse as fish, toads and birds are more likely to attack prey or food items viewed with their right eye. Even humpback whales prefer to use the right side of their jaws to scrape sand eels from the ocean floor. Genetics Plays a part in determining lateralisation, but environmental factors have an impact too. Rogers found that a chick's lateralisation depends on whether it is exposed to light before hatching from its egg — if it is kept in the dark during this period, neither",
  "hemisphere becomes dominant. In 2004, Rogers used this observation to test the advantages of brain bias in chicks faced with the challenge of multitasking. She hatched chicks with either strong or weak lateralisation, then presented the two groups with food hidden among small pebbles and the threatening Shape of a fake predator flying overhead. As predicted, the birds incubated in the light looked for food mainly with their right eye, while using the other to check out the predator. The weakly-lateralised chicks, meanwhile, had difficulty performing these two activities simultaneously.",

In 2009, Maria Magat and Culum Brown at Macquarie University in Australia wanted to see if there was general cognitive advantage in lateralisation.

  "birds can derive so much energy from these grubs that they only need to eat a few each day. This would mean that they wouldn't have to spend most Of their waking time searching for food, as most animals do. The beetle larvae have a distinct chemical make-up which can be traced through the feathers and blood of birds that eat them. Scientists have collected samples from crows in order to estimate the proportion of larvae in-their-dicl. They should then be able to gauge the extent to which individual birds depend on using sticks to feed themselves.",
